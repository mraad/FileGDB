# Spark GDB

In the wake of the unpredictable future of User Defined Types (UDT), this is a hasty minimalist re-implementation of the [spark-gdb](https://github.com/mraad/spark-gdb) project, in such that the content of a [File GeoDatabase](https://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/0309/files/9reasons.pdf) can be mapped to a *read-only* [Spark DataFrame](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html).  It is minimalist as it only supports features with simple geometries (for now :-) with no M or Z.

In the previous implementation, a `GeometryType` was defined using the UDT framework. However, in this implementation, points are stored in a field with two sub-fields x and y. 
~~Polylines and polygons are stored as a string in the [Esri JSON format](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/common-data-types/geometry-objects.htm).  It is not the most efficient format, but will make the interoperability with the [ArcGIS API for Python](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/) a bit seamless.~~ Polylines and Polygons shapes are stored as two sub fields, `parts` and `coords`. Parts is an array of integers, where the values are the number of points in the part. Coords is an array of doubles, where the values are a sequence of x,y pairs.

*Notes:*

- This implementation does **not** support compressed file geo databases.
- It is HIGHLY recommended to create a fully compacted feature class before using this implementation.
- The best way to create a compacted feature class is to copy the edited feature class to a new feature class.
- Date field is a timestamp with UTC timezone.

### Changes

- Sep 10, 2021, Version 0.41 is a breaking change in the `FileGDB` object.

## Building the project using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/):

```bash
mvn clean install
```

## Usage

The best demonstration of the usage of this implementation is with [PySpark DataFrames](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/dataframes-datasets/introduction-to-dataframes-python.html) and in conjunction with the [ArcGIS API for Python](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/).

Create a Python 3 [conda](https://conda.io/docs/) environment:

```python
conda remove --yes --all --name py36
conda create --yes -n py36 -c conda-forge python=3.6 openjdk=8 findspark py4j
```

```bash
conda create --name arcgis python=3.6
conda activate arcgis
conda install -c esri arcgis
conda install matplotlib
```

Assuming that the environment variable `SPARK_HOME` points to the location of a Spark installation, start a Jupyter notebook that is backed by PySpark:

```bash
export PATH=${SPARK_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
export SPARK_LOCAL_IP=$(hostname)
export PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=jupyter
export PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON_OPTS='notebook'
export GDB_MIN=2.11 # Spark 2.3
# export GDB_MIN=2.12 # Spark 2.4
export GDB_VER=0.18
pyspark\
 --master local[*]\
 --num-executors 1\
 --driver-memory 16G\
 --executor-memory 16G\
 --packages com.esri:webmercator_${GDB_MIN}:1.4,com.esri:filegdb_${GDB_MIN}:${GDB_VER}
```

Check out the [Broadcast](Broadcast.ipynb) and [Countries](Countries.ipynb) example notebooks.

Here is yet another example in Scala:

```scala
import com.esri.gdb._

val path = "World.gdb"
val name = "Countries"

val spark = SparkSession.builder().getOrCreate()
try
{
    spark
      .read
      .gdb(path, name)
      .createTempView(name)

    spark
      .sql(s"select CNTRY_NAME,SQKM from $name where SQKM < 10000.0 ORDER BY SQKM DESC LIMIT 10")
      .collect()
      .foreach(println)
}
finally
{
    spark.stop()
}
```

## TODO

- **Write test cases. Come on Mansour, u know better !!**
- ~~Save geometry as a struct(type,xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax,parts,coords)~~
- Add option to skip reading the geometry.
- Add option to return geometry envelope only.
- Add option to return timestamp field as millis long.
- Read geometry as WKB.
- ~~Add geometry extent as subfields to `Shape`.~~

### Notes To Self

- Install JDK-1.8
- Set path to %JAVA_HOME%\bin,%JAVA_HOME%\jre\bin
- keytool -import -alias cacerts -keystore cacerts -file C:\Windows\System32\documentdbemulatorcert.cer
